          A honest conversation with Brooke Ayano (also known as @ewwwitsbrooke) about whether Instagram is a fantasy and if it can ever be reality. Through her fashion and lifestyle content creation on Instagram and TikTok, Brooke also loves to share her honest and real thoughts on different issues whether it’d be about racism, politics and pop culture.

            </span>
          I think that Instagram truely is a highlight reel at the crux of it all, and so it is a fantasy most of the time. It very rarely depicts people in an honest light with all their hardships, scars and struggles on display. Instagram is a way for people to share the stylised polished version of their life. But on the flip side, some of the most real and honest updates I’ve seen of people’s lives have been online! Especially in this pandemic, I think it has really shown us to be a little more human online because we aren’t all that different. Everyone is going through similar struggles, or issues of their own in some sort of capacity!

          </span>
          Unfortunately, Instagram will always paint a picture that it is better than the real thing, even if it’s only by a small margin. You definitely can minimise the damage by following people that actively post ‘more real’ content but that number is far smaller than you realise. People have manipulated the lighting, chosen the background meticulously, have their makeup and hair done, and their outfit might not have even been what they wore that day! Thousands of photos have been taken, only to delete 90% of them. That doesn’t even cover the editing and filters to further the illusion.

            <br>
          </span>
          I personally stay away from retouching anything on my face and usually wear no makeup in my posts! Especially as a content creator, I don’t want to portray a false image of what I look like and mislead people; most days I’m not wearing makeup and that’s just the honest truth. I update on my stories when I am having an off day and even sometimes leave a question box to let people dump their own feelings somewhere; even replying if I feel like someone needs to be checked in with! I am a firm believer in the fact that your feed is largely made up of people who you interact and follow, and therefore I train my algorithm by following inspiring people, unfollowing those who I don’t resonate with and interacting with content that’s positive to me.
